# snoCAD-X v1.0.7.b

snoCAD-X is an open source CAD program for designing skis and
snowboards. It was written by Dan Graf of Graf Snowboards in 2007 and
has been widely used since then. In 2014 it was open sourced here in
order to allow the greater ski and snowboard bulding community to
carry it forward.

snoCAD_X is published on Github at https://github.com/mikemag/snoCAD-X

More information about ski and snowboard construction can be found at
[SkiBuilders.com](http://www.skibuilders.com/).

## Documentation

See the [snoCAD-X Userâ€™s
Guide](https://github.com/mikemag/snoCAD-X/blob/master/snoCAD-X_UserGuide.doc)
for an overview of how to use and configure snoCAD-X.

## License

snoCAD-X is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 except as
otherwise noted. See
[LICENSE](https://github.com/mikemag/snoCAD-X/blob/master/LICENSE) for
details.

## Current Release

See the [Releases page](https://github.com/mikemag/snoCAD-X/releases)
for the current release, which includes release notes and links to
download binaries.

Simply download the zip and double-click snoCAD-x.jar to launch the
app on any platform with Java installed. See the release notes for
more details.

### Running on macOS

To run on current versions of macOS (11+ at least) you will need to authorize each .jar file in the download. Go into the `lib`
directory, right click on each .jar file in turn and select "Open". macOS isn't happy that the files aren't from a trusted source,
and this will allow them to be used. Now right click on snoCAD-X.jar and select Open and the app should launch and work without issue.

## Dependencies

snoCAD-X currently depends on the following packages:

* Built with NetBeans 8.0.1
* iText 2.1.4
* jlfgr 1.0
* Swing 1.0.4
