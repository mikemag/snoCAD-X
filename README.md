# snoCAD-X v1.0.7.b

snoCAD-X is an open source CAD program for designing skis and
snowboards. It was written by Dan Graf of Graf Snowboards in 2007 and
has been widely used since then. In 2014 it was open sourced here in
order to allow the greater ski and snowboard bulding community to
carry it forward.

snoCAD_X is published on Github at https://github.com/mikemag/snoCAD-X
